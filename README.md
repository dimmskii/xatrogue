# Xatrogue
Quake 2 game code for all-in-one expansion pack support.
The game lib format is supposed to be working with any vanilla Q2 client, including 3.20.

This code was initially forked from Mark Shan's KMQuake II Official Missionpack Support sources. After that, it contains a few fixes and missing functions.

# Compiling under Linux
It compiles with gcc-7.4.0! This is currently the only method. Simply fire up the Makefile.
This will compile either an i386 or x86_64 .so file depending on your arch.

# Compiling under Windows
Coming soon: build with LCC. I need to re-create that Makefile I lost...
