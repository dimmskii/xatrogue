Quake 2 game code for all-in-one expansion pack support.
The game lib format is supposed to be working with any vanilla Q2 client, including 3.20.

This code is forked from Mark Shan's KMQuake II Official Missionpack Support sources. It contains a few fixes and missing functions. It compiles with gcc-7.4.0!
