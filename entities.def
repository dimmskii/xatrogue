at the center of the bursh.

If targeted it will not be shootable, unless the inactive flag is set.
INACTIVE - Specifies that the entity is not explodable until triggered. If you use this you must
target the entity you want to trigger it. This is the only entity approved to activate it.

health defaults to 100.

mass defaults to 75.  This determines how much debris is emitted when
it explodes.  You get one large chunk per 100 of mass (up to 32) and
one small chunk per 25 of mass (up to 64).  So 3200 gives the most.

delay- How long to wait before exploding, useful for a chain of func_explosives.

If targeted it will not be shootable, unless the inactive flag is set.

Inactive -	Specifies that the entity is not shootable until triggered.
Fade -		Specifies that the entity will fade away after coming to a rest.
				Time to fade is specified by "fadeout".  Default: 30 seconds.
AlwaysShoot-	Damagable even if targeted.
TargAngle-		Will rotate toward "move_angles" when dislodged.  Useful for objects that fall over flat.  Use "duration" for how many seconds the rotation takes.  Default: 5, will also always be > "wait"

"health"	Defaults to 100.
"health2"	How much health to destroy the brush after it has come to a stop.
"mass"		Defaults to 500.  This determines how much damage the falling boulder does.
"speed"		Defaults to 100.  This sets how fast the brush will move (only if triggered).
"angles"	Sets the initial angle that the brush will move at.  Use pitch, yaw, and roll.
"delay"		How long to wait before breaking away, default 0.
"wait"		How long before it becomes SOLID_BBOX after being dislodged, default 0.3.
"fadeout"	If the Fade flag is set, this is how long until it fades away.
"noise"		Sound to play when it hits.
"count"		Number of times to play impact sound

"target"	Will fire all entities with this targetname when it breaks free.
"deathtarget"	Will fire all entities with this targetname when it breaks free.

To have other entities move with the brush, set the door pieces' movewith values to the same as the brush's targetname and they will move in
unison, and will also fade away in unison if the Fade spawnflag is set.  Be sure to use the AlwaysShoot spawnflag if you want it to be shootable.
NOTE: All the pieces must be created after the brush entity, otherwise they will move ahead of it.

Firing rate: When sounds=1, 2, 3, 4, or 7 (RG, RL, BFG, HomingRL, GL), "wait" sets the number of seconds to wait between weapon firing events. Note: An additional skill-level dependent "reaction time" delay is added to this, as described by the formula:

   [reaction time]=[2-skill]/2

So if a RL turret uses wait=1, on normal skill the actual time between firings would be 1.5 seconds. Damage level: When sounds=5 or 6 (MG or HB), "wait" sets the amount of damage points each shot will do (firing rate is fixed at 10 shots/second). Ignored when sounds=-1. Default=2.

Key/Value pairs:
"style" Specifies the animation type to use.

   2: ANIM23 - cycle between frames 2 and 3 at 2 hz
   3: ANIM_ALL - cycle through all frames at 2 hz
   4: ANIM_ALLFAST - cycle through all frames at 10 hz

Note: The animation flags override startframe and framenumbers settings you may have enterered. ANIM_ALL and ANIM_ALLFAST don't do what you might think - rather than setting a framerate, these apparently cause the model to cycle through its ENTIRE sequence of animations in 0.5 or 0.1 seconds... which for monster and player models is of course not possible. Looks exceptionally goofy.

"skinnum"		The skin number to use, default 0
"health"		If non-zero and solidstate is 3 or 4 (solid), the entity will be shootable. When destroyed, it blows up with a no-damage explosion. 
"solidstate" 
	1 - not solid at all. These models do not obey any sort of physics. If you place them up in the air or embedded in a wall they will stay there and be perfectly happy about it. 
	2 - solid. These models will "droptofloor" when spawned. If the health value is set they may be damaged. 
	3 - solid. Same as above but not affected by gravity. Model will remain in the same location. 
	4 - not solid but affected by gravity. Model will "droptofloor" when spawned. 
NOTE : if you want the model to be solid then you must enter vector values into the following fields :

/*QUAKED model_train (1 0 0) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) START_ON TOGGLE BLOCK_STOPS PLAYER NO_MODEL ROTATE ROT_CONST SMOOTH
A moving model. The "team" key allows you to team train entities together.

Spawnflags:
	PLAYER		Set this if you want to use a player model
	NO_MODEL	Don't use a model. Usefull for placing particle effects and	dynamic lights on their own
	SPLINE: If set, the func_train will follow a spline curve between path_corners. What this means is you can create near perfectly smooth curvilinear paths with a handful of path_corners. The train will constantly turn to face the direction it is moving (unless yaw_speed and pitch_speed are negative values). For a couple of examples, see the rottrain and lcraft example maps (available on the downloads page.) The shape of the spline curve is controlled by the location and pitch and yaw angles of the train's path_corners. Train roll angle will vary linearly between path_corner roll angle values (the third component of the angles vector). 
-----------------------
Key/Value pairs:
"style" Specifies the animation type to use.
   0: None (unless startframe and framenumbers are used)
   1: ANIM01 - cycle between frames 0 and 1 at 2 hz
   2: ANIM23 - cycle between frames 2 and 3 at 2 hz
   3: ANIM_ALL - cycle through all frames at 2 hz
   4: ANIM_ALLFAST - cycle through all frames at 10 hz

Note: The animation flags override startframe and framenumbers settings you may have enterered. ANIM_ALL and ANIM_ALLFAST don't do what you might think - rather than setting a framerate, these apparently cause the model to cycle through its ENTIRE sequence of animations in 0.5 or 0.1 seconds... which for monster and player models is of course not possible. Looks exceptionally goofy. 

"usermodel"		The model to load (models/ is already coded)
"startframe"	The starting frame : default 0
"framenumbers"  The number of frames you want to display after startframe
"skinnum"		The skin number to use, default 0
"health"		If non-zero and solidstate is 3 or 4 (solid), the entity will be shootable. When destroyed, it blows up with a no-damage explosion. 
"target"		first path_corner"
"team"			func_train or func_rotating
"solidstate"
     1 = Not solid (default)
     2 = Bounding box
NOTE : if you want the model to be solid then you must enter vector values into the following fields :
"bleft" = the point that is at the bottom left of the models bounding box in a model editor
"tright" = the point that is at the top left of the models bounding box in a model editor

"speed"		How fast the model should move
"accel"		Acceleration
"decel"		Deceleration

"pitch_speed"	(Nose up & Down) in degrees per second (defualt 20)
"yaw_speed"		(Side-to-side "wiggle") in degrees per second (default 20)
"roll_speed"	(Banking) in degrees per second toward the next path corner's set roll
"dmg"			default	2, damage to inflict when blocked
"noise"			Sound model makes while moving(path/file.wav)

To have other entities move with the model train, set the door pieces' movewith values to the same as the train's targetname and they will move in
unison, and also still be able to move relative to the train themselves, and can be attached and detached using target_movewith.
NOTE: All the pieces must be created after the model train entity, otherwise they will move ahead of it.

/*QUAKED misc_actor (1 .5 0) (-16 -16 -24) (16 16 32) Ambush TrigSpawn Sight GoodGuy NoGib Homing BeMonster IgnoreFire
"angle" Specifies the facing angle of the actor on the XY plane. Default=0.
"angles" Specifies the facing angle of the actor in 3 dimensions as defined by pitch, yaw, and roll. Default=0 0 0.
"bleft" Specifies bottom-left (minY/minX/minZ) bounding box coordinates for the actor relative to the actor's origin.
"combattarget" targetname of the point_combat the actor will move to when angered.
"deathtarget" targetname of the entity to be triggered upon the actor's death.
"dmgteam" An actor with a dmgteam value set will treat all attacks upon other actor(s) or monster(s) with the same dmgteam value as an attack on himself. May also be used to trigger a trigger_relay.
"flies" Specifies the probability that the actor's corpse will produce flies. When they appear, they will have a duration of 60 seconds before they expire. Flies will never appear if the actor's corpse is in a liquid. Normal probability values range from 0.00-1.00; 0.00=0% probability (never produce flies); 1.00=100% probability (always produce flies). If flies>1, the actor will have flies buzzing about him even while alive. Default=0.
Ignored if health<0, unless flies=1. In that event, the initially dead actor will have flies which never expire.
"gib_health" Specifies the number of hit points required to gib the actor's corpse. Ignored when NO_GIB is set. Default=40.
"health" Specifies the number of hit points required to kill the actor. Default=100
   If health=0 it will be reset to the default.
   If health<0 the actor will be dead on startup.
   If health=100000 or more the actor is invulnerable, and will ignore attacks.
"item" entity to be spawned by the actor upon his death.
"killtarget" targetname of the entity to be removed from the map upon the actor's death.
"mass" weight of the actor. Default=200.
"movewith" targetname of the parent entity the actor is to movewith.

"muzzle2" Specifies an optional 2nd weapon firing origin, offset from the actor origin.
"powerarmor" Specifies amount of optional power shield armor the actor has. Default=0. Experiment with settings using the weapons the actor will face - it looks odd for a actor to die before his power shield runs out.
"sounds" weapon to use. Default=0
     0 : None
   100 : Blaster
   200 : Shotgun
   300 : Super Shotgun

  1300 : ETF Rifle
  1400 : Plasma beam
  1500 : Disintegrator
"style" Specifies the 0-based index of the skin the actor will use. Default=0. The valid range for style is 0 to the number of skins referenced from within the model itself minus one. What number references what skin is dependent on the individual model. If the style value +1 exceeds the number of referenced skins, skin 0 will be used. The number of available skins for all player models distributed with Lazarus are given in the ActorPak documentation. 
"target" targetname of the path_corner the actor will move to.
"targetname" Name of the specific actor.
"tright" Specifies top-right (maxY/maxX/maxZ) bounding box coordinates for the actor relative to the actor's origin. If no value is specified for either tright or bleft, and the value of usermodel is a player model in the Lazarus ActorPak, then the suggested bounding box as listed on the ActorPak page for that model will be used. 
"usermodel" Specifies the player model used. Value is the name of the model's "player" folder. No default is specified for usermodel. If the model folder contains custom sounds, misc_actor will use them; otherwise it will fall back to using male model sounds.
